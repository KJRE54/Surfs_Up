# **SURFS UP ANALYSIS CHALLENGE**

## **Overview of the Analysis**
### Purpose
The young entrepreneur wants to open a surf and icecream shop in Hawaii with the help of investors.
He needs to determine if that is feasible based on location and temperature which could have a major
impact on the sales of his business. The entrepreneur has to analyze temperature data in areas he may likely open
his business and provide feeback to his investors.


## Results
### Three Major Take-Aways

Examining the statistics on the temperature, I find three take-aways are:

- There is no substantial difference between the June and December temperatures. The temperatures
  remain relatively stable. There may be no appreciable change in temperature (+/- 3 stamdard deviation points) 
  from June to December which may bode well for his business sales.
  
 - He has to look out for December temperatures, because all though they stay in-line with June temps, the
   December temps have from time to time fallen below the 70s. Those days may impact his surfing and icecream sales.
   So, he may have to account for that in his revenue estimates for December forecasts.
   
 - The entrepreneur had fewer December temperature datapoints (1,517) than in June (1,700).  But, we hope that the lesser data
   does not skew substantially the overall result of his analysis.

### Hi-level Summary

The most important result of this is that the entrepreneur should open his business.  Hopefully, this data will be sufficient to 
convince the investors to give him money to do so.
